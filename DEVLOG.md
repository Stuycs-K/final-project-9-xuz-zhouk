### Working Features:
- Implementation of gravity that pulls fruits downwards after they are initially launched
- The fruits/powerups/bombs will be continuously spinning in a 2D manner
- Implementation of "lives" in Arcade Mode: every time a fruit is dropped, you lose a life; lose 3 lives and it's game over
- Progressive difficulty: the fruits will spawn faster and faster as time passes
- Slicing detection: the fruits/powerups/bombs can be sliced and produce their respective effects; fruit/powerup halves maintains velocity and spin after being sliced
- Scores: during a run, the current score will be displayed; after more than 1 run in a mode, the high score and number of retries on that mode will also be displayed
- Buttons: the pause button, upon being pressed, will pause the current run; the back button will bring the user back to the start menu
- Start menu: there are two spinning fruits; slice the fruit you want to determine the mode that you want to play on
- Cursor trail to emulate a "blade" for the slicing
- Stains will be produced at the location the fruit is sliced in; the stain will eventually fade away
- Combo multipliers will be produced when multiple fruits are sliced at the same time
